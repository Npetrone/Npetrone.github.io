Attempting to change your career can be daunting. Especially taking such a leap into a field that you've never had any experience in, let alone even seen what that field can offer and what it entails. Sometimes (like me, personally), the pressure can be felt to move into a career that can support a family one day, that can offer fulfilment and many opportunities available under that field.

I've decided to attempt to change my career into a Software Engineer because I didn't want to be left behind in this changing world. Everywhere you turn, there's a necessity to understand how machinery and programs operate. I'm excited to learn about something that is challenging, yet rewarding when getting over roadblocks. Although I've never had experience in this field, I feel like commiting to the program and changing my career would offer an opportunity to change my life for the better.
